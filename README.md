Rain Man Alexa Skill

Rain Man predicts whether it will rain or not. 

### Invocations
You can invoke Rain Man by saying things like:
- Alexa, ask Rain Man if I need a raincoat today
- Alexa, ask Rain Man if it's going to rain
- Alexa, ask Rain Man if I'd use an umbrella today

Rain Man knows you are busy and isn't going to waste your time.

If it isn't going to rain Rain Man will say: _No_

If it is going to rain Rain Man will say: _It is going to rain_

This is a simple skill for people who want to know if it's going to rain without hearing an entire weather forecast.
